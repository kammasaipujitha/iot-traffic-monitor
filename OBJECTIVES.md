# Project Objectives

**Project Title:** IoT-Based Traffic Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi and Deep Learning

### Main Goals:
- Use IoT camera to capture live traffic images.
- Send data to a cloud or local server using MQTT.
- Use a deep learning model (YOLO or CNN) to detect and count vehicles.
- Analyze traffic density and generate alerts for congestion.
- Publish results to a dashboard or web interface.

### Step 1 Deliverable:
- Create repo and confirm Raspberry Pi setup and camera connectivity.
